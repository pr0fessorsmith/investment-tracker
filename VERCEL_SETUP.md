# Vercel Environment Variables Setup

## Your Deployment is Now Ready! üöÄ

The code has been fixed to handle missing Supabase environment variables gracefully. The build will now succeed even without them configured.

## Adding Supabase Environment Variables to Vercel

To enable cloud storage in production, you need to add your Supabase credentials to Vercel:

### Step 1: Get Your Supabase Credentials

Open your `.env.local` file and copy these two values:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### Step 2: Add to Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project (`investment-tracker`)
3. Click **Settings** tab
4. Click **Environment Variables** in the left sidebar
5. Add each variable:
   - **Key**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - **Value**: (paste your Supabase URL)
   - **Environments**: Check all three boxes (Production, Preview, Development)
   - Click **Save**
   
   - **Key**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - **Value**: (paste your Supabase anon key)
   - **Environments**: Check all three boxes (Production, Preview, Development)
   - Click **Save**

### Step 3: Redeploy

After adding the environment variables:
1. Go to the **Deployments** tab
2. Click the three dots `...` on the latest deployment
3. Click **Redeploy**

OR simply push a new commit (already done!) and Vercel will automatically redeploy.

## What Happens Now?

### Without Environment Variables (Current State):
‚úÖ App builds successfully
‚úÖ App runs without errors
‚úÖ Users can use localStorage (data stored locally in browser)
‚ùå Cloud storage disabled
‚ùå Google Auth won't work

### With Environment Variables (After Setup):
‚úÖ App builds successfully
‚úÖ App runs without errors
‚úÖ Users can use localStorage (unauthenticated)
‚úÖ Cloud storage enabled for authenticated users
‚úÖ Google Auth works
‚úÖ Data syncs across devices
‚úÖ Migration tool available for existing users

## Testing

After adding environment variables and redeploying:
1. Visit your Vercel URL
2. Click "Sign in with Google"
3. After login, you should see the migration modal if you had local data
4. Create a new transaction - it will be saved to Supabase
5. Open the app on another device with the same Google account - your data will be there!

## Support

If you encounter issues:
- Check Vercel deployment logs for errors
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Check Supabase dashboard for database activity
- Look at browser console for any client-side errors
